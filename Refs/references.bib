@article{hochberg:wafer,
	Abstract = {We report for the first time two typical phase coherence lengths in highly confined silicon waveguides fabricated in a standard CMOS foundry's multi-project-wafer shuttle run in the 220nm silicon-on-insulator wafer with 248nm lithography. By measuring the random phase fluctuations of 800 on-chip silicon Mach-Zehnder interferometers across the wafer, we extracted, with statistical significance, the coherence lengths to be 4.17 {\textpm} 0.42 mm and 1.61 {\textpm} 0.12 mm for single mode strip waveguide and rib waveguide, respectively. We present a new experimental method to quantify the phase coherence length. The theory model is verified by both our and others' experiments. Coherence length is expected to become one key parameter of the fabrication non-uniformity to guide the design of silicon photonics.},

@article{MIT:uncertainty,
	Abstract = {Process variations can significantly degrade device performance and chip yield in silicon photonics. In order to reduce the design and production costs, it is highly desirable to predict the statistical behavior of a device before the final fabrication. Monte Carlo is the mainstream computational technique used to estimate the uncertainties caused by process variations. However, it is very often too expensive due to its slow convergence rate. Recently, stochastic spectral methods based on polynomial chaos expansions have emerged as a promising alternative, and they have shown significant speedup over Monte Carlo in many engineering problems. The existing literature mostly assumes that the random parameters are mutually independent. However, in practical applications such assumption may not be necessarily accurate. In this paper, we develop an efficient numerical technique based on stochastic collocation to simulate silicon photonics with correlated and non-Gaussian random parameters. The effectiveness of our proposed technique is demonstrated by the simulation results of a silicon-on-insulator based directional coupler example. Since the mathematic formulation in this paper is very generic, our proposed algorithm can be applied to a large class of photonic design cases as well as to many other engineering problems.},

	Abstract = {The Hopkins imaging theory for partially coherent light is adapted to include vector EM field interference inside a resist film stack. The negligible on-axis component of the EM field before the entrance pupil is ignored and this form is suitable for modeling IC lithographic projection printing. A new module, called TCCcalc, that is part of the Mentor Graphics" Calibre Workbench modeling suite includes the vector image model inside resist can faithfully capture all physical effects that take place. Reduced contrast of the TM polarization, induced spherical aberration and standing wave creation are identified through examples to be the most important effects at high NA imaging. Application of the new vector image model to experimental data leads to a 20% reduction in the error between simulation and experiment for NA up to 0.75.},

	Abstract = {The realization of semiconductor lasers on Si substrates will enable the fabrication of complex optoelectronic circuits. This will permit the creation of the long-dreamed chip-to-chip and system-to-system optical interconnects. This paper reports recent developments in our work on InAs/GaAs quantum-dot (QD) lasers monolithically grown on Si, Ge, and Ge-on-Si (Ge/Si) substrates. A thin AlAs nucleation layer (NL) was first investigated for the growth of InAs/GaAs QDs on Si substrates. The AlAs NL enables more defects to be confined in the interface between the GaAs epitaxial layer and Si substrate, and hence leads to higher photoluminescence intensity for InAs/GaAs QDs. Room-temperature lasing at 1.29 \u03bcm with a threshold current density of 650 A/cm2 was demonstrated with the use of an AlAs NL. The growth of InAs/GaAs QDs on Ge and Ge/Si substrates was further studied. A low threshold current density of ~200 A/cm2 for 1-mm long QD lasers has been demonstrated for QD lasers grown on Ge substrates by using Ga prelayer technique. This growth technique has also been explored for Ge/Si substrates. Room-temperature lasing at 1.28 \u03bcm with threshold current density of ~164 A/cm2 and lasing operation up to 84$\,^{\circ}$C has been demonstrated for a 3-mm long device.},

@article{novack2013germanium,
	Abstract = {Germanium-on-silicon photodetectors have been heavily investigated in recent years as a key component of CMOS-compatible integrated photonics platforms. It has previously been shown that detector bandwidths could theoretically be greatly increased with the incorporation of a carefully chosen inductor and capacitor in the photodetector circuit. Here, we show the experimental results of such a circuit that doubles the detector 3dB bandwidth to 60 GHz. These results suggest that gain peaking is a generally applicable tool for increasing detector bandwidth in practical photonics systems without requiring the difficult process of lowering detector capacitance.},

@article{fiers2012time-domain,
	Abstract = {We present a tool that aids in the modeling of optical circuits, both in the frequency and in the time domain. The tool is based on the definition of a node, which can have both an instantaneous input-output relation and different state variables (e.g., temperature and carrier density) and differential equations for these states. Furthermore, each node has access to part of its input history, allowing the creation of delay lines or digital filters. Additionally, a node can contain subnodes, allowing the creation of hierarchical networks. This tool can be used in numerous applications such as frequency-domain analysis of optical ring filters, time-domain analysis of optical amplifiers, microdisks, and microcavities. Although we mainly use this tool to model optical circuits, it can also be used to model other classes of dynamical systems, such as electrical circuits and neural networks.},

@article{ackert2011defect-mediated,
	Abstract = {We present a study on the effects of inert ion implantation of Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) racetrack resonators. Selective ion implantation was used to create deep-level defects within a portion of the resonator. The resonant wavelength and round-trip loss were deduced for a range of sequential post-implantation annealing temperatures from 100 to 300 {\textdegree}C. As the devices were annealed there was a concomitant change in the resonance wavelength, consistent with an increase in refractive index following implantation and recovery toward the pre-implanted value. A total shift in resonance wavelength of ~2.9 nm was achieved, equivalent to a 0.02 increase in refractive index. The excess loss upon implantation increased to 301 dB/cm and was reduced to 35 dB/cm following thermal annealing. In addition to providing valuable data for those incorporating defects within resonant structures, we suggest that these results present a method for permanent tuning (or trimming) of ring resonator characteristics.},

@article{burla2013integrated,
	Abstract = {Integrated Microwave photonics (IMWP) signal processing using Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as an enabling technology for a number of functionalities not attainable by purely microwave solutions. In this context, integrated waveguide Bragg grating (WBG) devices constitute a particularly attractive approach thanks to their compactness and flexibility in producing arbitrarily defined amplitude and phase responses, by directly acting on coupling coefficient and perturbations of the grating profile. In this article, we review recent advances in the field of integrated WBGs applied to MWP, analyzing the advantages leveraged by an integrated realization. We provide a perspective on the exciting possibilities offered by the silicon photonics platform in the field of MWP, potentially enabling integration of highly-complex active and passive functionalities with high yield on a single chip, with a particular focus on the use of WBGs as basic building blocks for linear filtering operations. We demonstrate the versatility of WBG-based devices by proposing and experimentally demonstrating a novel, continuously-tunable, integrated true-time-delay (TTD) line based on a very simple dual phase-shifted WBG (DPS-WBG).},

Bragg gratings are formed in a silicon waveguide by ion implantation induced amorphization, and are subsequently erased by a contained laser thermal treatment process. An extinction ratio up to 24dB has been demonstrated in transmission for the fabricated implanted Bragg gratings with lengths up to 1000{\textmu}m. Results are also presented, demonstrating that the gratings can be selectively removed by UV pulsed laser annealing, enabling a new concept of laser erasable devices for integrated photonics.},

A universal design methodology for grating couplers based on the silicon-on-insultator platform is presented in this paper. Our design methodology accomodates various etch depths, silicon thickness (e.g., 220 nm, 300 nm), incident angles, and cladding materials (e.g., silicon oxide or air), and has been verified by simulations and measurement results. Further more, the design methodology presented can be applied to a wide range, from 1260 nm to 1675 nm, of wavelengths.

@article{wang2012narrow-band,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate the design, fabrication and measurement of integrated Bragg gratings in a compact single-mode silicon-on-insulator ridge waveguide. The gratings are realized by corrugating the sidewalls of the waveguide, either on the ridge or on the slab. The coupling coefficient is varied by changing the corrugation width which allows precise control of the bandwidth and has a high fabrication tolerance. The grating devices are fabricated using a CMOS-compatible process with 193 nm deep ultraviolet lithography. Spectral measurements show bandwidths as narrow as 0.4 nm, which are promising for on-chip applications that require narrow bandwidths such as WDM channel filters. We also present the die-to-die nonuniformity for the grating devices on the wafer, and our analysis shows that the Bragg wavelength deviation is mainly caused by the wafer thickness variation.},

The results presented in this paper can be applied to three major applications: Thermo-optical tuning of optical resonators, thermo-optical modulator and wide range/high sensitivity temperature sensors. While quantifying the temperature effects, this paper also provides useful answers on how critical the temperature parameter is in the optical cavity behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Important active technologies, modulators, photodetectors, and thermooptics for low-energy silicon optical interconnects are discussed. High-speed performance up to 40 Gb/s is reported for the silicon modulators and germanium photodetectors, and approaches for further improvement in speed and efficiency are presented. Low-voltage avalanche multiplication is demonstrated, giving a gain-bandwidth product of 75 GHz, while the combined effects of multiplication gain and the Franz-Keldysh effect enable a 5-μm-long germanium photodetector to achieve responsivity in the L-band that is comparable to that in the C-band. With trench-based thermal isolation, a low switching power of 0.4 mW is achieved for a thermooptic switch.},

	Abstract = {We present manufacturing tolerances of cascaded silicon microring resonators fabricated in a commercial 130-nm complementary-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry using 193-nm lithography and provide statistics gathered from over 500 four-channel microring arrays over multiple wafers and fabrication lots. We quantify intrawafer and interwafer variation of the position and relative spacing of resonance wavelengths for the microring arrays and confirm prior predictions that the absolute resonance positions of such devices cannot be controlled across wafers or even across reticles within a wafer. However, we show that the free spectral range (FSR) of the microrings can be controlled to within 0.66 nm (83 GHz) across wafers and lots, as can the wavelength spacing between closely spaced microrings. To exploit these findings for low-power optical interconnects, we suggest and demonstrate a synthetic resonant comb with FSR ≈ N * δλ, wherein resonance wavelengths are spaced equally across the FSR in order to minimize postfabrication tuning. The experimental CMOS 1 × 8 microring array requires an average tuning of less than 1.2 nm/channel to align to a 200-GHz wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) grid. Monte Carlo simulations on 100 000 sample runs show that an average tuning of 1.72 nm/channel is sufficient for 99% coverage for this component. This indicates that it is possible, with high statistical confidence, to use high-volume CMOS manufacturing to reduce the tuning range and tuning energy requirements of silicon microrings and, hence, enhance their ability to be used in high-density, energy-efficient computing system applications.},

	Abstract = {We present the design and experimental demonstration of a contra-directional grating-coupled racetrack resonator exhibiting the Vernier effect. The device consists of two racetrack resonators that are coupled together in a cascaded configuration. The input coupler in each racetrack resonator of the cascaded configuration consists of contra-directional gratings. The benefit of using contra-directional couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without contra-directional grating couplers. Specifically, we eliminate the free spectral range (FSR, i.e., in both the drop port and the through port) and show substantial improvement in the interstitial peak suppression and the through port insertion loss for the cascaded racetrack resonator with gratings, as compared to the case without gratings. In addition, experimental results are presented, which show an interstitial peak suppression of 29.3 dB, as well as the elimination of the FSR in the drop port and the through port.},

@article{nedeljkovic2011free-carrier,
	Abstract = {We present relationships for the free-carrier-induced electrorefraction and electroabsorption in crystalline silicon over the 1-14-μm wavelength range. Electroabsorption modulation is calculated from impurity-doping spectra taken from the literature, and a Kramers-Kronig analysis of these spectra is used to predict electrorefraction modulation. More recent experimental results for terahertz absorption of silicon are also used to improve the commonly used 1.3- and 1.55-μm equations. We examine the wavelength dependence of electrorefraction and electroabsorption, finding that the predictions suggest longer wave modulator designs will, in many cases, be different from those used in the telecom range.

Owing to the small sidewall surface roughness achieved by processing on a standard 200mm CMOS fabrication line, minimal propagation losses of 3.6{\textpm}0.1dB/cm for the TE polarization were measured at the telecommunications wavelength of 1.5{\textmu}m. Losses per 90{\textordmasculine} bend are measured to be 0.086{\textpm}0.005dB for a bending radius of 1{\textmu}m and as low as 0.013{\textpm}0.005dB for a bend radius of 2{\textmu}m. These record low numbers can be used as a benchmark for further development of silicon microphotonic components and circuits.},
